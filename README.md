# Astro-Boy
> Stranded on the moon, the lone survivor of a space crash, an astronaut must repair the remains of his dilapadated ship in order to make it back to Earth. With resources running out, he only has a limited amount of time (6 turns) before the cold dusty haze of loneliness settles eternally in his mind. Can he do it?
> A two player game where a user inputs a hidden word to be guessed by another player. The second player has 6 turns to guess correctly or until the song in the background finishes.

## General Info
The game is called Astro Boy on the pun of the original title: Space Man. The game is also refered to as Snowman and Hangman. The title is also a nod to the famous classic manga: Astro Boy. The project assignment was designed to test my abilities with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. A lot of the small features are implemented with a space theme in mind.
